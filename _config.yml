Personal Statement:
My name is Teresa Lopes and I‚Äôm Portuguese. I‚Äôve moved to the UK from sunny Portugal five years ago to pursue a better life. Up until now I was working as a nurse, however I needed a career change, so I decided to take my love for people and caring to the next level, by emerging myself in the world of people‚Äôs profession. I love working with people and that‚Äôs why I am so excited to start my career in the Human Resources area.
In my role as a nurse, I developed essential knowledge and skills transferable to my new area of interest, Human Resources, such as communication and relational skills, time management, teamwork, conflict resolution, performance reviews, leadership and even stress management.
Ive completed a diploma in Leadership & Management, which has provided me with an amazing insight into the relevance of appropriate management and leadership in the workplace; it has also provided me with the necessary skills to undertake a manager or leader role. I‚Äôm currently finishing the CIPD level 5 diploma in Human Resources Management, which has equipped me with amazing tools to be able to continue my work caring for people.
Im fluent in English, but also Portuguese and Spanish, and I‚Äôm presently working on my French! I‚Äôm enthusiastic and eager to learn, I‚Äôm quick on my feet, organized, resourceful, reliable, creative, a perfectionist (which sounds like a flaw, but it means I‚Äôll always give my absolute best in any task), I‚Äôm very sociable and a great communicator‚Ä¶ talking to people comes natural to me. I‚Äôm also not afraid to be original and unconventional!
I‚Äôm currently looking for a job in Tech recruitment!

Personal Skills:
Communication and relational skills, leadership skills, conflict resolution and stress management skills, organizational and managerial skills, and time management skills.
I also had the opportunity to complete relevant training in my practice as a nurse, which includes Therapeutic Boundaries, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/ Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Stress Management and Conflict Resolution training.
Finally, I also possess a UK Driving License	B1, B.
